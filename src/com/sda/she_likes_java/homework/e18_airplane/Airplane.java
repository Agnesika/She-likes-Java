Exercise 18.
Create an Airplane class that provides the following operations:
- takeOff
- land
- flyTo(int xCoordinates, int yCoordinates)
- retrieve the current state of the aeroplane (flies/waits in hangar)When implementing, remember that:
- the aircraft must be in the air to land
- you cannot take off if you are already in the air
- use variables to store internal state
- check the use of your class in the main method
- have fun
